# Parallel skyline queries

This is the code to run different implementations of parallel skyline queries with different kinds of datasets.
To run this you need to install PySpark in your computer.
Instead if you have docker installed just build the image and run it (replace name with whatever you want).

- docker build -t name .
- docker run -v /app name

To use the dataset that I used in the method get_CSV_Many_SkyPoints, simply download the file here:
